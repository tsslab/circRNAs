# circRNAs

Here we present processed circRNA data associated with our study characterising embryonic circular RNAs in zebrafish.


## Project Description

Circular RNAs are a puzzling class of RNAs with covalently closed loop structure, lacking 5’ and 3’ ends. Present in all cells, no unifying theme has emerged regarding their function. Here, we use transcriptional data obtained by *biotagging* in zebrafish to uncover a high-resolution cohort of embryonic circRNAs expressed in nuclear and polysomal subcellular compartments in three developmental cell types. The ample presence of embryonic circRNAs on polysomes contradicts previous reports suggesting only nuclear localization. We uncover a novel class of circRNAs, significantly enriched at tandem duplicated genes. Using an NGS-based approach, we simultaneously screen and resolve the full sequence of putative “tandem-circRNAs” and their underlying mRNAs.  These form by long-range *cis*-splicing events often between distant tandem duplicated genes, resulting in chimaeric mRNA transcripts and circRNAs containing supernumerary complementary excised exons, integrated from multiple tandem loci. Taken together, our results suggest that circularisation events rather than circRNAs themselves are functionally important.
